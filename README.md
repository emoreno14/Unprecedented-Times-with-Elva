# Unprecedented-Times-with-Elva

## Project Details 

I created Unprecedented Times With Elva for my Digital Humanities class. As a digital humanist in the making, I will be discussing different tools and texts, all while talking about the influenced of COVID in my community (Lincoln, Nebraska). I will specifically focus on the University of Nebraska- Lincoln and Downtown Lincoln. On my blog, you can click on Blog under the title to read my reports. Additionally, I used Hour of Code to create a game that allows the player to experience my feelings through COVID-19. Below are the first three DH Dev. Reports.
